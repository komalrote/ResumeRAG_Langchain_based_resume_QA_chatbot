# ResumeRAG_Langchain_based_resume_QA_chatbot
This project is a smart chatbot that can read my own resume PDF and answer questions about it. Using LangChain and AI, the chatbot can quickly provide information about my education, work experience, skills, and other details from the resume. It makes it easy to query my resume without manually going through it.
